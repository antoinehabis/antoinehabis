### Hi there 👋



I'm a doctoral student 📖 at Institut Pasteur ⚕️ & Télécom-Paris 🏫.

My thesis focuses on segmentation in Histopathology but the methods used extend to all types of images.

I created 3 segmentation methods that or both interactive and/or non-interactive.


Also, I'm passionate 🤟 about mathematics, tennis 🎾 and badminton 🏸
