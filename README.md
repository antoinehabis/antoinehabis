### Hi there 👋




I am a freshly graduated PhD 📖 from Télécom Paris 🏫 and Institut Pasteur ⚕️ , where I focused on applying artificial intelligence to histology. 

During my thesis, I developed three different segmentation methods—both interactive and non-interactive—utilizing various levels of supervision to improve histological analysis.

In addition to my academic work, I enjoy playing badminton 🏸, tennis 🎾, and chess :chess_pawn:, which help me balance the mental challenges of research with physical and strategic activities I love.
